Submission # 2
Progress : Trouble compiling the first program, we continue to get errors saying our lexer cannot pass the first line and collum despite trying different tests that should definetly make it further before failing. We are planning on attending all office hours available to us moving forward to resolve this. 

Makefile parse successful and executable aquired but it is uncertain whether or not it is working or if we are simply missing the command needed to compile correctly.
